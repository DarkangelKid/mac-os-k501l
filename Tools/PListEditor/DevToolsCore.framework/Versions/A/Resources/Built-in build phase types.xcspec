    Built-in build phase types

    The build phase types that are built into Xcode.  While any or all of these could theoretically be overridden by separate specification property lists, Xcode 3.0 has practical limitations (in terms of what's coded into the corresponding Objective-C classes that back these build phase types) that make it very hard if not impossible to add new kinds of build phase types.  These limitations are expected to be lifted in some future version of Xcode.  Meanwhile, however, some aspects of build phases, such as the set of default build settings or the list of default build rules, can be modified without problem.  Needless to say, doing so may radically change how Xcode builds all projects, so it should not be done lightly or without careful thought.
